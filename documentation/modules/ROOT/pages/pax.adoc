= Pax

Pax is the umbrella for all https://www.osgi.org[OSGi] projects at https://github.com/ops4j[OPS4J].
OSGi is a runtime platform that allows for a much higher degree of dynamicity and modularity than any other container architecture and is well suited for both client and server applications.

https://www.eclipse.org[Eclipse] is the most visible OSGi ecosystem on the market, housing many UI driven OSGi projects including a runtime framework. https://knopflerfish.org[Knopflerfish] as well as https://felix.apache.org/[Apache Felix] are other runtime platforms, with their respective standard services.

Pax intends to be complimentary to all these efforts and main focus are on good practices and technology integration.

Feel free to start or suggest additional subprojects.
